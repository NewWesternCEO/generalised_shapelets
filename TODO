Get information on the different data-types from:
    • Image outline
    • Sensor reading
    • Motion capture
    • Spectography
etc. We can then analyse performance over the types.


Automate the evaluation done in jupyter notebooks. We should list any params that are being edited and save the analysis
plots in the run folder.
